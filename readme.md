# My First Tutorial
* How to use AWS
* How to build a serverless Crud API using Node.js
* How to build and deploy a react.js application

## Commands I am learning via serverless-stack.com

The Notes below are for setting up the Serverless Framework

* handler.js file contains actual code for the services/functions that will be deployed to AWS Lambda

* serverless.yml file contains the configuration on what AWS services Serverless will provision and how to configure them

* We also have a tests/ directory where we can add our unit tests

* aws-sdk allows us to talk to the various AWS services

* uuid generates unique ids. We need this for storing things to DynamoDB

## Got Stuck

* Adding plugins -serverless-webpack and -serverless-offline
